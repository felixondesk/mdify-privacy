# Privacy Policy for MDify

**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

MDify ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension ("MDify") collects, uses, and discloses your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

MDify is designed to respect your privacy. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers.**

### Page Content
MDify accesses the content of the web pages you visit **locally on your device** for the sole purpose of converting that content into Markdown format. This process happens entirely within your browser. The scraped content is not sent to any third-party servers by MDify automatically.

### AI Platform Injection
When you explicitly choose to inject content into an AI platform (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity), MDify will copy the converted Markdown content into the input field of the selected platform. This action is triggered **only by your direct interaction** (clicking a button). Once injected, the content is subject to the privacy policy of the respective AI platform.

## 2. Permissions

MDify requires the following permissions to function:

-   **Read and change data on all websites (`<all_urls>`)**: This is required to allow the extension to scrape the content of any article or documentation you wish to convert to Markdown.
-   **Clipboard**: To allow you to copy the generated Markdown to your clipboard.
-   **ActiveTab**: To interact with the currently active tab when you open the extension popup.

## 3. Data Storage

MDify does not use cookies or local storage to track your usage. All processing is transient and occurs in memory while the extension is active.

## 4. Third-Party Services

MDify interacts with the following third-party AI platforms only at your request:
-   Anthropic (Claude)
-   OpenAI (ChatGPT)
-   Google (Gemini)
-   xAI (Grok)
-   Perplexity AI

Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information on how they handle data you submit to them.
